Liri node app

LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

2. Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.

3. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests using the `axios` package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs.
